# @i_remember_txt

This [Twitter bot](@i_remember_txt) tweets random excerpts from Joe Brainard's "I Remember" (1975).

There are 1500 separate "stanzas" of memories in the original text. The prepared subset contains only stanzas that could be easily broken down into 140 character chunks. In cases where the stanza is longer than a single line, it waits a minute and sends additional lines as replies to the first.

Inspiration for the bot came from [Avery Trufelman](https://twitter.com/trufelman/status/820687962266402816).
